#### LeaRning Week 2 Homework Questions ####

# Below are a set of questions that will test what you have learned from Week 2's lesson on data frames

# 1 ####
# Read in the LeaRning_week2_cfu_data.csv. Save it to an object called "dat".



# Viewing our data ####

# 2 ####
# Print the first three rows of the data set



# 3 ####
# Print the last four rows of this data set



# 4 ####
# Determine how many "Control" values there are in the experimental.group variable (hint - use table)



# 5 ####
# Determine how many "Control" values there are in the experimental.group variable for the tissue spleen (hint - you can either subset the data first, or use table for two variables)



# 6 ####
# print a unique list of tissues



# modifying the data ####

# 7 ####
# Change the tissue variable into a character



# 8 ####
# Now change the values "spleen" in the "tissue" variable to "spl"



# Subsetting data ####

# 9 ####
# Subset the data set so no.cfu is greater than 0. Save this to a new data set called dat.2.



# 10 ####
# now subset the data so that the experimental group is Control, and the tissue is liver. Save this to a new object called dat.3



# 11 ####
# subset the data so that the dilution factor is equal to 10 OR no.cfu is greater or equal to 20. Save this in a new object called dat.4



# 12 ####
# subset the data so that the tissue does not equal lung. Save this to a new object called dat.5
